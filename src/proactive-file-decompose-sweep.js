// [chipping away at an oversized file] a standard part of agent-manager hygiene so that
// when working on future projects it just automatically happens" -- confirmed live: this
// whole session's app.py work was ME picking the next slice, filing it, and waiting for a
// go-ahead every single time, with no waiting task ever forcing the issue).
//
// decompose-loop-autoroute.js's sweep already authors + files a moves[] plan for an
// oversized file -- but only REACTIVELY, when a task is already stuck against it
// (stalenessFlag.reason === 'decompose-loop'). A file that file-length-scan.js still
// flags but that nothing is currently blocked on (exactly app.py's state after a session
// of manually clearing its backlog) never gets touched -- there's no waiting task to
// react to, so the reactive sweep finds nothing to do every single tick, forever.
//
// This is the proactive counterpart: for any still-oversized file with no existing
// file-decompose-request/hub and no active task stuck on it, author + file a fresh plan
// the SAME way (same runFileDecomposePlanPass, same file-decompose-to-hub.js
// materialisation) with no waiting task required at all. Reuses everything
// decompose-loop-autoroute.js already built rather than reimplementing any of it -- the
// two sweeps differ only in what they iterate over and what happens to the (nonexistent,
// here) stuck task afterward.
//
// NO upfront hot-file skip here (2026-09-14 fix -- screaminggoatclubmt: "we need these
// things broken down into manageable chunks as we build them... why is that timer set to
// a week" -- found live: app.py's flask-blueprint plan is Tier-1-eligible, a single
// deterministic one-pass commit that can't go stale, but the old upfront check ran BEFORE
// a plan even existed, so it had no way to know that and blocked it for a full week
// anyway). file-decompose-to-hub.js's fileHub() now applies the hot-file check itself,
// AFTER every Tier-1 short-circuit has had its chance, so it only ever defers the
// multi-day Tier-2 hub case this guard actually exists for.
//
// Bounded to ONE new plan per run (MAX_FILES_PER_RUN) -- same "small, scoped, don't dump
// the whole backlog on the pipeline at once" discipline as this session's manual slicing.
//
// THROTTLE (2026-09-14, screaminggoatclubmt: "why not remove the max files per run
// altogether? ... make sure the process continues by spawning the next task after the
// task is finished, otherwise if the next task is only queued by the 24 hour scan").
// A flat daily quota was never tied to anything that actually mattered -- not worker
// capacity, not review throughput, not the risk of filing many attempts against a
// still-young mechanism at once. Replaced with a self-regulating cap on how many
// decompose-derived branches are currently APPLIED BUT NOT YET MERGED
// (countOutstandingDecomposeBranches), split Tier1 (fast, single atomic commit, safe --
// looser cap) vs Tier2 (multi-day per-move hub, worker-hungry -- stricter cap). Merging
// one frees a slot immediately: task-log-reconcile.js already stamps a task's `merged`
// history stage on EVERY watchdog tick (scripts/queue-watcher.sh's main loop runs every
// ORC_TICK_SECS, default 60s), so the very next tick after a merge sees the freed
// capacity -- no separate "on merge" event hook needed, just a short time floor
// (CHECK_INTERVAL_MS, now minutes not a day) so a full oversized-file scan + plan-pass
// attempt doesn't re-run on literally every 60s tick when there's nothing new to do.
// PLUS an on-demand --force flag for the "project just became the active target" trigger
// (see app.py's _start_pipeline, which spawns this in the background on every project
// switch/start) -- force bypasses the time floor but NOT the outstanding-branches cap.
