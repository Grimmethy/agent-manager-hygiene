// file-decompose-plan-pass.js (2026-09-03, Grimmethy: "we need to figure out a way to get
// hub 1 to decompose itself ... make the system do the work without stepping in").
//
// The gap: a task whose target is a 5,000+ line file loops forever in the decompose
// backstop -- every attempt answers "decompose" but never produces usable pieces, because
// the local 27B cannot hold the whole file in its head to decide WHERE the module
// boundaries go (jsg0 / the job-list stage-groups hub, live). file-decompose-to-hub.js
// already turns a `moves[]` plan into a (stacked) hub the 27B CAN execute -- but authoring
// that plan was a human step.
//
// This pass authors it, cheapest strategy first:
//
//   A. SECTION GROUPING (no model). Big source files are already organised behind comment
//      banners -- `// --- Discovery tab ---`, `// Plugins tab -- ...`, a `@app.route`
//      URL-prefix family. Assign each symbol its nearest preceding banner; a section-count
//      overflow no longer bails to the model (see the packing note below) -- it bin-packs
//      instead. Zero model risk.
//
//   B. MODEL GROUPS SECTIONS. Only reached now when fewer than 3 usable sections survive
//      the fan-out filter below (too sparse for the deterministic packer to work with) --
//      hand the model the SECTIONS as the unit, a far smaller labelling task than 147 raw
//      names (the job-list case, where flat-name grouping produced no usable split, live
//      2026-09-03).
//
//   C. MODEL GROUPS NAMES. No banner structure at all -> the original flat-name approach,
//      only for a file small enough (<= FLAT_NAME_CEILING) that one pass can hold it.
//
// Every grouped symbol is validated against the deterministically extracted set before the
// plan is written. Injectable `call` for tests; A + the parsers need no model.
//
// FAN-OUT FILTER (2026-09-14, screaminggoatclubmt: "we analyze the plan itself... why
// isn't it producing quality results"). Root-caused live: app.py's comment-banner
// sectioning put 77 symbols under one "LAN access" label, but most of them were actually
// file-wide utilities (queue_dir, read_env_file, get_active_repo_root) that just happened
// to sit under that banner physically -- referenced from routes in a dozen OTHER sections.
// Tier B's model call was only ever shown a label + a count + 8 example names, with no
// cross-reference information, so it had no way to know that and bundled the whole section
// into one 83-symbol module -- rejected by validatePlan's AST preflight only AFTER the
// full plan was built, with no feedback into a better attempt.
//
// Fix: BEFORE any grouping (deterministic or model), reuse the SAME AST reference scan
// validatePlan's own staticCheckMove already runs (file-decompose-to-hub.js), one section
// at a time, to find every symbol referenced from OUTSIDE its own section. Those are
// cross-cutting shared utilities, not movable features -- exclude them from every tier's
// candidate pool entirely (left behind in the source file) rather than discovering the
// same problem only after a full plan fails preflight. This also means Tier A's packer can
// now trust that every remaining section is genuinely self-contained, which is what lets
// it safely bin-pack an arbitrary number of sections instead of bailing past 8.
